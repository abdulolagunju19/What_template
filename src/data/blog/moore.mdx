## Professor Sarah Moore Q&A

1. How do you get ready for your day? 
--> Haha, usually quickly, because I am getting my daughter ready for the day too (she's 5)! We're renovating our house right now, and are living close enough to campus to walk, which I'm really enjoying - even the walk from the parkade (when I drive) helps get some space, quiet, and outside time before work, and I find that helpful.

2. What was most surprising to you about life as a professor? 
-->  How free and how constrained your time is at the same time; many things (teaching, admin/committee work) are fixed - but when you get time for research, it's wide open, which requires a lot of intrinsic motivation.
 
3. Is there an achievement or contribution that you are most proud of? 
--> I'm proud of two projects. The first project looked at how talking about our own experiences in particular ways changes how we feel about them, and so gives consumers some guidance on how they should talk about these. In a nutshell, to recover from bad experiences you should explain why they happened and why you felt negative about them; to maintain feelings of positivity for good experiences you should NOT explain them - just describe and relive them. The second project looked at how customer service agents should talk to customers to increase satisfaction. In a nutshell, they should say "I" (the firm) instead of "we" (the company), and this makes customers happier (which is important for firms and customers - this has even been applied in hospitals).
 
4. If you could go back in time to before you went into academia, what advice would you give to yourself?
--> To worry less about being an imposter and whether I could succeed - and also to realize that everybody feels that way a little bit.
 
5. How difficult is it to convince people in industry to adopt your proposals?
--> I don't do a lot of direct persuading on that score - I do outreach through press releases, publications in trade journals (like the Harvard Business Review), and things like webinars and presentations, to convey my research both to firms and consumers.
