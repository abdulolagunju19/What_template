## Let's Begin with a Story

It's been a long pandemic. Zoom breakout rooms, SEM webcams, and very little communication. However, even before the pandemic, were we really communicating as well as we could? The University of Alberta is one of the biggest universities in Canada. Groundbreaking research, ideas, and people are constantly flowing through these buildings. I have always felt like more could be done to share this information. So, me and my roomate Raunak decided to do something about this. We sat down, and really discussed how we could better market the incredible projects that happen here every day. From that conversation, we decided to start a small website in which we interview the people making special things happen, and share this information in an informative and interesting way.
<br></br>
For now, we will be conducting interviews with student clubs, student leaders, and professors conducting research on campus. We'll give you a little taste into a day in the life for these people, and try to establish a forum in which people with great ideas have an environment in which they can bring these ideas to fruition.

For us to say that we are in a community, we need to communicate with one another. So, we’ll take that first step. We have an audacious goal. We want to have a forum of sorts, in which students can interact with those on campus who are striving to bring their ideas to life. This, in essence, is what our “What’s it like to be” series of interviews wishes to accomplish. A faster spreading of ideas and sharing of resources between industry, faculty, students, and people interested in getting a better idea of what the University of Alberta is all about.

## The Future

We hope to have a podcast, interactive website, forum linked with University of Alberta Emails, and film crew that details a day in the life of University of Alberta residents. There will be events in which students can learn from people in industry who wish to share knowledge. We will release monthly newsletters that will let students know people from a wide array of faculties. Thanks for reading this, and we hope that you can support us on this journey.
