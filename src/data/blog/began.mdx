## Our Vision

So, this Stanford Article caught my eye. It gave a little outlook into what some researchers were doing, but I feel like we could really take it up a notch. For us to say that we are in a community, we need to communicate with one another. So, we’ll take that first step. We have an audacious goal. We want to have a forum of sorts, where students can interact with the personal profiles of those on campus who are striving to bring their ideas to fruition. This, in essence, is what our “What’s it like to be” series wishes to accomplish. A faster spreading of ideas and sharing of resources between industry, faculty, students, and people interested in interesting ideas.

We hope to have a podcast, interactive website, forum linked with university of Alberta Emails, and film crew that details the day in the life of University of Alberta residents. There will be a form where students can ask a question to a scientist. We will release monthly newsletters that will let students know people in the faculty of science. Let’s bring this to life, and in turn bring the University to life.
